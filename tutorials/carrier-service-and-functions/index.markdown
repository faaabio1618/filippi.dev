# Introduction

Delivery methods can greatly vary among different stores. The Shopify interface allows you to create unique shipping
profiles based on the weight and price of the cart. However, sometimes you might have too many rules to apply.

The [Carrier Service API](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/carrierservice)
provides an easy way to create a custom shipping method, albeit with some limitations.

Functions can be used to enhance the carrier service API, and we will see how.

## The goal

![Goal Plot](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/goal-plot.svg#centered)

Our customer hands us a csv like this

```csv
max_weight_kg,price,service
1,10,Carrier 1
1,15,Carrier 2
3,12,Carrier 1
4,18,Carrier 2
...
36,98,Carrier 1
100,150,Carrier 2
```

And then, adds in a hush, "Also, shipping should be free for customers tagged as 'VIP'."

Hence, our objective is to **display the appropriate shipping prices based on the weight, and offer free delivery for
all methods if the customer is tagged as 'VIP'.**

# Carrier Service API

It seems the Carrier Service API is not very familiar to developers, so let's begin with a quick overview.

Implementing a carrier service does not require creating an app; you only need to establish a public endpoint that can
receive a POST request from Shopify and return a JSON response.

The store must subscribe to the _Advanced Shopify_ plan or higher to install a custom carrier service.

## The input

Let's define the input using Typescript

```typescript

type CarrierServiceRequestBody = {
    rate: {
        origin: ShopifyAddress,
        destination: ShopifyAddress,
        items: [CartItem],
        currency: string,
        locale: string
    }
}
type ShopifyAddress = {
    country: string,
    postal_code: string,
    province: string,
    city: string,
    name: string,
    address1: string,
    address2: string,
    phone: null, // always null
    address3: null, // always null
    fax: null // always null,
    email: null, // always null
    address_type: null, // always null
    company_name: null // always null
}
type CartItem = {
    name: string,
    sku: string,
    quantity: number,
    grams: number,
    price: number,
    vendor: string
    requires_shipping: boolean,
    taxable: boolean,
    fulfillment_service: string,
    properties: any,
    product_id: number,
    variant_id: number,
}
```

The input is a JSON object that matches the `CarrierServiceRequestBody` type.

Some fields such as `phone`, `address3`, `fax`, `email`, `address_type`, and `company_name` will always be null.

Additionally, we don't receive any information about the customer, so we can't determine whether they are tagged
as `VIP` or not.

## The output

The output is a JSON object of type `CarrierServiceResponseBody`

```typescript
type CarrierServiceResponseBody = {
    rates: [
        {
            currency: string,
            description: string,
            service_code: string,
            service_name: string,
            weight_min_lb: number,
            weight_max_lb: number,
            total_price: number // in cents
        }
    ]
}

```

From the output, it's clear that you can return multiple shipping methods, each with a unique price and weight range.

You don't need to calculate the weight of the items; simply return all the applicable shipping methods with their
corresponding weight ranges. **Shopify will only display the methods that fall within the correct weight range**.

You might want to calculate the cart's price if you have a formula for determining the shipping cost based on weight.

Interestingly, the input weight is in grams while the output is in pounds, which I find quite amusing.

## Implementation using Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers are an excellent choice for implementing a carrier service due to their cost-effectiveness and ease
of deployment. There are several other methods to implement a REST API, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions,
Azure Functions, etc. However, I find Cloudflare Workers to be the most developer-friendly.

To start the project we need to download
the [Cloudflare Workers CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update).

Then, following [the documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) we can create a new
project

```shell
$ yarn create cloudflare
```

And when asked we will choose the option `Hello World` and `TypeScript`.

```shell
â•­ Create an application with Cloudflare Step 1 of 3
â”‚
â”œ In which directory do you want to create your application?
â”‚ dir ./my-carrier-service
â”‚
â”œ What type of application do you want to create?
â”‚ type "Hello World" Worker
â”‚
â•° Do you want to use TypeScript?
    Yes / No
```

This will create a new folder with a file `src/index.ts` containing a hello world example.

```typescript
export interface Env {
}

export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
        return new Response('Hello World!');
    },
};
```

We have almost everything, we just need to create and retrieve the configuration.

## Configuration on Cloudflare

To host the configuration, we'll utilize [Cloudflare KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/). We'll convert our CSV
into a JSON object and store it in KV.

First, we need to create a KV namespace, after which we can upload the configuration.

```shell
$ wrangler kv:namespace create "SHIPPING_CONFIG"
ðŸŒ€ Creating namespace with title "my-carrier-service-SHIPPING_CONFIG"
âœ¨ Success!
Add the following to your configuration file in your kv_namespaces array:
{ binding = "SHIPPING_CONFIG", id = "6..............................4" }
```

In the folder previously created with a `wrangler.toml` file, we can add the namespace to the `kv_namespaces` array.

```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "SHIPPING_CONFIGURATION"
id = "6..............................4"
```

We simply convert the .csv into a .json file (without altering the structure):

```json

{
  "rates": [
    {
      "min_weight_kg": 0,
      "max_weight_kg": 1,
      "price": 10,
      "service": "Carrier 1"
    },
    {
      "min_weight_kg": 0,
      "max_weight_kg": 1,
      "price": 15,
      "service": "Carrier 2"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

and we can upload it to KV.

```shell
$ wrangler kv:key put --binding-"SHIPPING_CONFIG" "shipping_config" "$(cat config.json)"
```

If you're having difficulty with the command, you can use the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) to
upload the correct value.

![KV upload](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/kv-upload.png#centered)

## Implementation

Now we can implement the carrier service.

```typescript
export interface Env {
    SHIPPING_CONFIGURATION: KVNamespace;
}

type RateConf = {
    'min_weight_kg': number,
    'max_weight_kg': number,
    'price': number,
    'service': string
}

type RatesConf = {
    'rates': RateConf[]
}

const DEFAULT_RATES: RatesConf = { // this is not needed, Shopify will provide a default delivery price in case of error or empty response
    'rates': [{
        'min_weight_kg': 0,
        'max_weight_kg': 0.1,
        'price': 5,
        'service': 'Carrier 1'
    }, {
        'min_weight_kg': 0.1,
        'max_weight_kg': 0.1,
        'price': 5,
        'service': 'Carrier 2'
    }
    ]
};

export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
        // const body : CarrierServiceRequestBody = await request.json(); we don't need this, but here we would have the Shopify request body
        const value: RatesConf = JSON.parse(await env.SHIPPING_CONFIGURATION.get('rates') || 'null') || DEFAULT_RATES;
        const rates = value.rates.map((rate) => {
            return {
                currency: 'EUR', // this could be put in configuration
                description: '', // if left empty is not shown
                service_code: rate.service,
                service_name: rate.service, // this is what is shown at checkout
                weight_min_lb: rate.min_weight_kg * 2.20462,
                weight_max_lb: rate.max_weight_kg * 2.20462,
                total_price: rate.price * 100 // this would be better to be saved in cents in the configuration
            };
        });

        return new Response(JSON.stringify({'rates': rates}));
    }
};
```

## Deploy

To deploy the carrier service we need to run

```shell
$ wrangler deploy
```

Now under the Cloudflare dashboard we can test the endpoint, and we should see something like this

![Worker Output](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/worker-output.png#centered)

## Installation

### Get an access token

To integrate the carrier service, we need to add it using
the [REST Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/unstable/resources/carrierservice#post-carrier-services) (
strangely enough, GraphQL doesn't yet support carrier service mutations).

We need an _Authentication Token_ to utilize the REST API. This can be generated from the Shopify dashboard under
_Settings_ -> _Apps and Sales Channels_ -> _Develop Apps_ -> _Create An App_. Continue to _Configure Admin API Scopes_
and ensure you select `write_shipping`. Save and click on _Install App_. This will provide an access token for us to
execute the REST call.

![Access Token](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/access_token.png#centered)

### Adding the Carrier Service

Now we can make the REST call to install the carrier service.

```shell
$ curl -d '{"carrier_service":{"name":"My Custom Carrier Service","callback_url":"https://my-carrier-service.filippi.workers.dev/","service_discovery":true}}' \
-X POST "https://your-development-store.myshopify.com/admin/api/2023-10/carrier_services.json" \
-H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: {access_token}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"

{"carrier_service":{"id":6.........4,"name":"My Custom Carrier Service","active":true,"service_discovery":true,"carrier_service_type":"api","admin_graphql_api_id":"gid:\/\/shopify\/DeliveryCarrierService\/6.........4","format":"json","callback_url":"https:\/\/my-carrier-service.filippi.workers.dev\/"}}
```

For `name`, we input the name to be displayed in the shipping settings. `callback_url` refers to the URL of our worker,
while `service_discovery` is set to true to allow Shopify to locate the carrier service. As a response, we receive the
ID of the carrier service, which could be useful for updating or deleting the service.

### Adding the carrier service to a shipping profile

You can now navigate to _Settings_ -> _Shipping and delivery_ and click on your shipping profile. If you already see
your carrier service under _Carrier and app rates_, skip this step. If not, click on _Add rate_ -> _Use carrier or app
to calculate rates_ and select your new carrier service.

In either case, you should click on the three dots, then _Edit Rate_ to configure the carrier service. You will need to
select all the available services your API provides, if desired.

![Carrier Service Configuration 1](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/carrier_1.png#centered)
![Carrier Service Configuration 2](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/carrier_2.png#centered)

## Testing

We're finally done, we can check now at checkout that we have the right shipping methods.

![Checkout](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/checkout.png#centered)

Success!

## FAQ on Carrier Service API

- Q: *What happens if my API is not responding or generates errors?*  
  A: If no rate is provided, Shopify will use
  a [backup rate](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/backup-rates) based
  on the weight of the cart.
- Q: *Why can't I see a new service I added?*  
  A: You must select the new service (a new service code) in the shipping profile every time you add one. If it still
  doesn't appear (which can sometimes happen), try removing the carrier service and re-adding it using the REST call.
- Q: *Why does the checkout price remain the same despite me changing it?*  
  A: The carrier service response is cached. Try using a different address.
- Q: *Why can't I see the carrier service in the shipping profile?*  
  A: Ensure the REST API provided a successful response and that you have an ID. You can
  use [this API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2023-10/resources/carrierservice#get-carrier-services) to check
  all the installed carrier services.
- Q: *Can I retrieve the configuration from a file?*  
  A: Yes, you can. However, keep in mind that the API is called every time a customer moves to checkout, so you may want
  to cache the configuration in a KV namespace or, at the very least, ensure that it loads quickly.
- Q: *Can I use the customer's email?*  
  A: No, the customer's email is not provided in the request; it is always null.

# Shipping Function

The Carrier Service API is highly useful, but it comes with limitations. For instance, we cannot determine if a customer
is tagged as `VIP` and therefore cannot offer them free shipping. The only way to achieve this is by utilizing a
function.## Simplified Function

## Creating the function

To create a function we'll use the simplified deploy that allow us to not create an app.

```shell
$ npm init @shopify/app@latest
Welcome. Letâ€™s get started by naming your app project. You can change it later.

?  Your project name?
âœ”  my-delivery-function

?  Get started building your app:
âœ”  Start by adding your first extension
$ cd my-delivery-function
$ yarn shopify app generate extension
Before proceeding, your project needs to be associated with an app.
?  Create this project as a new app on Shopify?
âœ”  Yes, create it as a new app
?  App name:
âœ”  my-delivery-function
?  Type of extension?
âœ”  Delivery customization - Function
?  Name your extension:
âœ”  my-delivery-customization
?  What would you like to work in?
âœ”  TypeScript
â•­â”€ success â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•®
â”‚                                                                                                          â”‚

â•°â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•¯
```

## First Implementation

### Input

To implement a function the first this is always to define the input, we modify the `src/run.graphql`:

```graphql
query RunInput {
    cart{
        buyerIdentity {
            email
            customer{
                isVIP: hasAnyTag(tags: ["VIP"])
            }
        }
        deliveryGroups {
            deliveryOptions {
                title
                handle
            }
        }
    }
}
```

So that in the request we will receive the email of the customer and `isVIP` will be true if the customer is tagged as
`VIP`.

After changing the file we must regenerate the types in typescript

```shell
$ cd extensions/my-delivery-customization
$ npm run shopify app function typegen
```

### Functions Limitations. Carrier Service for the help

Can we start implementing the function? Actually no. The problem is that **functions can't change a delivery price**.
Functions can only: **move**, **hide** or **rename** a delivery method.

To solve this we need to change our the implementation of our carrier service.
We will add a new delivery method (for each service) called `{FREE} Service X` and we will hide all the others methods
if the customer is not tagged as `VIP` (otherwise we will hide the free method).

### Updating the carrier service

Let's implement the changes to the carrier service.

```typescript

export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
        const value: RatesConf = JSON.parse(await env.SHIPPING_CONFIGURATION.get('rates') || 'null') || DEFAULT_RATES;
        let services: Set<string> = new Set();
        let rates: CarrierServiceResponse = {
            'rates': value.rates.map((rate) => {
                services.add(rate.service);
                return {
                    currency: 'EUR',
                    description: '',
                    service_code: rate.service,
                    service_name: rate.service,
                    weight_min_lb: rate.min_weight_kg * 2.20462,
                    weight_max_lb: rate.max_weight_kg * 2.20462,
                    total_price: rate.price * 100
                };
            })
        };
        services.forEach((service) => { // here we add the free delivery
            rates.rates.push({
                currency: 'EUR',
                description: '',
                service_code: service,
                service_name: '{FREE}' + service,
                total_price: 0
            });
        });
        return new Response(JSON.stringify(rates));
    }
};
```

And after deploying this is the result
![Free delivery](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/free-delivery.png#centered)

### First function implementation

In our attempt to implement the function we will start by hiding all the delivery methods that are not free if the user
is VIP and viceversa.

```typescript
export function run(input: RunInput): FunctionRunResult {
    let isVip = input.cart.buyerIdentity.customer.isVIP;
    const output: FunctionResult = {
        operations: []
    }

    function hideDeliveryOption(handle: string) {
        output.operations.push({
            hide: {
                deliveryOptionHandle: handle
            }
        })
    }

    function cleanFreeLabel(option: CartDeliveryOption) {
        output.operations.push({
            rename: {
                title: option.title.replace("{FREE}", ""),
                deliveryOptionHandle: option.handle
            }
        })
    }

    input.cart.deliveryGroups.forEach((group) => {
        group.deliveryOptions.forEach((option: CartDeliveryOption) => {
            if (option.title.includes('{FREE}')) {
                if (isVip) {
                    cleanFreeLabel(option);
                } else {
                    hideDeliveryOption(option.handle);
                }
            } else if (isVip) {
                hideDeliveryOption(option.handle);
            }
        });
    });
    return output;
}
```

Before deploy we need to update `shopify.app.toml` with the right permissions

```toml
scopes = "write_delivery_customizations,read_delivery_customizations"
```

Now we can deploy the app and the function

```shell
$ yarn deploy
?  Release a new version of my-delivery-function?
âœ”  Yes, release this new version

âœ” Created extension my-delivery-customization.

Releasing a new app version as part of my-delivery-function

my-delivery-customization â”‚ Building function my-delivery-customization...
my-delivery-customization â”‚ Building GraphQL types...
my-delivery-customization â”‚ Bundling JS function...
my-delivery-customization â”‚ Running javy...
my-delivery-customization â”‚ Done!
```

### Install the function

Because we have to chosen to not create an app we need to install the function manually.
We will use [Shopify GraphQL App](https://shopify-graphiql-app.shopifycloud.com/login) and run the following query

```graphql
mutation deliveryCustomizationCreate($deliveryCustomization: DeliveryCustomizationInput!) {
    deliveryCustomizationCreate(deliveryCustomization: $deliveryCustomization) {
        deliveryCustomization {
            id
        }
        userErrors {
            field
            message
        }
    }
}
```

With variables

```json
{
  "deliveryCustomization": {
    "enabled": true,
    "functionId": "{your function id found in the partner dashboard}",
    "title": "my-delivery-customisation"
  }
}
```

The function is now installed and ready to be used, and after having added the tag `VIP` to a customer we can see that

![Free](/tutorials/carrier-service-and-functions/free.png#centered)

... is working!

## Using Configuration

The last step will be to use configuration... https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/functions/input-output/variables-queries
