I'm Fabio Filippi. I am a software developer.

I'm currently _digital solution architect_ at [Quintessential Brands](https://quintessentialbrands.com){:target="_
blank"}, an international spirits company.

I have 10 years experience, and I've worked with many different technologies, but in the last 2 years I've been focusing
on Shopify stores and apps.
